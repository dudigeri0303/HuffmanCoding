1.Begin by copying the desired text into the Text.txt file.<br />
2.Run the project to initiate the encoding process.<br />
3.The program will encode the text by constructing a tree for the characters and then save the encoded characters to the save.txt file.<br />
4.Finally, it will decode the characters in the save.txt file, restoring the original text, and output the result to the standard output.<br />
